Even in the darkest circumstances, life holds meaning. Often, it calls on us to fulfill a task, achieve something significant, or support someone in need—and it is this sense of purpose that sustains us through challenges. Viktor Frankl shared this insight with his fellow prisoners after a day-long fast, protecting those who had risked punishment to steal a few potatoes.

In my years leading projects across continents and industries, I have seen that effective project management is more than schedules, budgets, and milestones—it is about purpose, responsibility, and the meaning we bring to our work. Every project, team, and challenge carries an expectation: to create value, support others, and leave a lasting impact.

Project management in regulated industries is both an art and a science—requiring technical expertise, disciplined process management, and the ability to lead diverse teams across functions and geographies. Throughout my career, I have managed complex programs in medical device and high-tech sectors across North America, Asia, and Europe. From multi-million-dollar technology transfers and new product development to mentoring global, cross-functional teams, I have seen how effective leadership transforms ideas into life-improving products.

Rather than condensing my career into bullet points, this booklet expands on the lessons I’ve learned—what worked, what mattered, and what it taught me about leadership, resilience, and purpose. Examples include transferring catheter and micro-catheter production lines from Japan to the U.S., leading cleanroom and facility upgrades in Korea, and developing thermoplastic and liquid silicone molding processes across Asia-Pacific. These experiences illustrate both challenges and best practices for project managers in regulated industries.

It is my hope that this booklet serves as both a reference and inspiration—equipping project leaders to navigate complexity, manage risk, and lead teams successfully while making a meaningful impact in their organizations.

Our work and accomplishments often define our lives, but discovering life’s meaning through our work is far more fulfilling.

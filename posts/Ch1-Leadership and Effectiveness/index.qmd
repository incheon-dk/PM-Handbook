## **Introduction**

Every great project—like every enduring organization—depends on leadership maturity. Jim Collins, in *Good to Great*, described five levels of leadership, from highly capable individuals to leaders who build enduring greatness through humility and will.\

In project management, a similar evolution occurs. As project managers grow, they shift from managing tasks to inspiring teams, integrating strategy, and ultimately shaping culture.

Having worked across technical, regulated, and multicultural environments—from precision optics at Moxtek to medical device programs spanning Asia, Europe, and the U.S.—I’ve observed these stages firsthand.\

Just as leaders ascend Collins’ pyramid, project managers progress from **technical experts** to **strategic influencers** who enable sustainable excellence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **The Five Levels of Leadership (Jim Collins)**

1.  **Level 1 – Highly Capable Individual:**\

    Makes productive contributions through talent, knowledge, skills, and good work habits.

2.  **Level 2 – Contributing Team Member:**\

    Works effectively with others in a group setting to achieve shared objectives.

3.  **Level 3 – Competent Manager:**\

    Organizes people and resources toward the effective pursuit of predetermined objectives.

4.  **Level 4 – Effective Leader:**\

    Catalyzes commitment to and pursuit of a clear, compelling vision; stimulates higher performance standards.

5.  **Level 5 – Executive (Level 5 Leader):**\

    Builds enduring greatness through a blend of personal humility and professional will.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **The Five Levels of Project Management Proficiency**

1.  **Level 1 – Technical Executor:**\

    Focuses on tools, schedules, and deliverables. Demonstrates strong technical and procedural understanding (e.g., design verification, documentation, timeline control).\

    *Example:* Early Moxtek roles—optimizing optical module processes and maintaining design control documentation.

2.  **Level 2 – Coordinated Contributor:**\

    Collaborates across functions and disciplines. Balances engineering and communication to ensure stakeholder alignment.\

    *Example:* Coordinating cleanroom upgrades between manufacturing, QA, and regulatory teams in Korea.

3.  **Level 3 – Integrated Planner:**\

    Manages full lifecycle projects, balancing time, cost, and scope. Leads cross-functional teams toward shared milestones and risk-managed outcomes.\

    *Example:* Transferring catheter production from Japan to the U.S., aligning engineering, supply chain, and validation teams.

4.  **Level 4 – Strategic Leader:**\

    Shapes vision, aligns programs with organizational strategy, and fosters team development. Coaches others, manages portfolios, and translates vision into execution.\

    *Example:* Mentoring emerging PMs in Asia-Pacific to standardize project practices under ISO 13485 compliance.

5.  **Level 5 – Purpose-Driven Leader:**\

    Embodies humility and purpose; mentors future leaders while ensuring organizational sustainability and meaning in the work.\

    *Example:* Integrating business improvement with human development—building teams that see project success as shared growth, not individual achievement.

## **Comparative Summary**

| **Jim Collins’ Leadership Level**  | **Parallel PM Proficiency Level** | **Key Focus**                       | **Example from Practice**                                    |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|------------------------|
| Level 1 – Capable Individual       | Level 1 – Technical Executor      | Technical competence and discipline | Verification and DHF compliance in early optical projects    |
| Level 2 – Contributing Team Member | Level 2 – Coordinated Contributor | Collaboration and communication     | Coordinating multi-site teams for cleanroom validation       |
| Level 3 – Competent Manager        | Level 3 – Integrated Planner      | Execution excellence and control    | Managing transfer of manufacturing lines and timelines       |
| Level 4 – Effective Leader         | Level 4 – Strategic Leader        | Vision, influence, and mentorship   | Establishing PM frameworks and coaching new PMs              |
| Level 5 – Executive Leader         | Level 5 – Purpose-Driven Leader   | Legacy, humility, and meaning       | Developing teams that sustain quality and innovation culture |

## **Reflection**

> Leadership, whether in life or in projects, is not merely about authority—it is about alignment and stewardship.
>
> As Jim Collins observed, greatness arises when competence meets humility. The same is true for project management maturity. The highest-performing project managers are not those who control most tightly, but those who inspire others to own the mission, contribute their best, and find meaning in shared achievement.

In my career, I’ve witnessed this transformation repeatedly: engineers becoming managers, managers becoming mentors, and teams becoming movements. The journey up both ladders—leadership and project proficiency—is not about climbing faster, but about deepening purpose at every level.

    "text": "Even in the darkest circumstances, life holds meaning. Often, it calls on us to fulfill a task, achieve something significant, or support someone in need—and it is this sense of purpose that sustains us through challenges. Viktor Frankl shared this insight with his fellow prisoners after a day-long fast, protecting those who had risked punishment to steal a few potatoes.\nIn my years leading projects across continents and industries, I have seen that effective project management is more than schedules, budgets, and milestones—it is about purpose, responsibility, and the meaning we bring to our work. Every project, team, and challenge carries an expectation: to create value, support others, and leave a lasting impact.\nProject management in regulated industries is both an art and a science—requiring technical expertise, disciplined process management, and the ability to lead diverse teams across functions and geographies. Throughout my career, I have managed complex programs in medical device and high-tech sectors across North America, Asia, and Europe. From multi-million-dollar technology transfers and new product development to mentoring global, cross-functional teams, I have seen how effective leadership transforms ideas into life-improving products.\nRather than condensing my career into bullet points, this booklet expands on the lessons I’ve learned—what worked, what mattered, and what it taught me about leadership, resilience, and purpose. Examples include transferring catheter and micro-catheter production lines from Japan to the U.S., leading cleanroom and facility upgrades in Korea, and developing thermoplastic and liquid silicone molding processes across Asia-Pacific. These experiences illustrate both challenges and best practices for project managers in regulated industries.\nIt is my hope that this booklet serves as both a reference and inspiration—equipping project leaders to navigate complexity, manage risk, and lead teams successfully while making a meaningful impact in their organizations.\nOur work and accomplishments often define our lives, but discovering life’s meaning through our work is far more fulfilling.\n\nDK, Wasatch Front, Fall 2025"

    "title": "Section 3: Defining and Protecting Project Scope",
    "section": "",
    "text": "During my years in project management, I once worked with a program manager who was a former Marine. He and I often discussed business operations in Asia—especially Korea—and while some of our conversations couldn’t be repeated, one thing always stood out: his absolute clarity on scope. He had an uncanny ability to determine, without hesitation, whether an activity was in scope or out of scope. I never quite knew how he did it, but he always knew exactly what was included in the contract and what wasn’t—and he wouldn’t budge an inch beyond it.\nThat discipline became one of the most valuable lessons I carried forward: in every project, knowing where the boundaries lie—and holding them—is what protects both progress and integrity.\n\nA project’s scope is its foundation—the clear boundary between what will be delivered and what will not. In regulated industries, scope definition is not simply a planning exercise; it is a compliance and quality requirement. A well-defined scope ensures that project objectives align with customer needs, business strategy, and regulatory expectations.\n\n1. The Project Charter – From Voice of Customer to Design Input\nEvery successful project begins with a strong project charter. The charter translates the Voice of the Customer (VoC)—the expressed and unspoken needs of users, clinicians, or stakeholders—into Design Inputs that are measurable, testable, and traceable.\nFor example, if a customer expresses the need for “a more comfortable catheter,” this VoC statement becomes a design input such as:\n\n“Catheter distal tip durometer shall not exceed 70 Shore A, verified through mechanical testing per ASTM D2240.”\n\nThese inputs then drive Design Outputs, such as material selection, process parameters, and dimensional drawings—tangible evidence of how requirements are met.\n\nFDA Design Control (21 CFR 820.30) requires that Design Inputs and Outputs be reviewed, verified, and validated to ensure the final product truly meets user needs.\n\n\n2. What’s In Scope and Out of Scope\nA clear scope statement delineates the project’s deliverables and exclusions.\n\nIn Scope items define the intended work—product specifications, documentation, testing, and regulatory submissions.\n\nOut of Scope items capture what the team will not do, preventing assumptions and future conflict.\nAt Moxtek, for example, defining in scope for a new optical coating system included the qualification of the sputtering chamber and process recipe validation—but explicitly excluded facility HVAC upgrades, which were owned by Facilities Engineering. This clarity prevented misalignment and resource contention later.\n\n\n3. Scope Creep – The Silent Project Killer\nScope creep occurs when new tasks or requirements are added without proper evaluation or approval. Even well-intentioned changes—“just a quick test” or “one more design tweak”—can derail budgets, schedules, and compliance timelines.\nTo manage this:\nEvaluate each change request through formal design control and risk assessment.\nUpdate the project plan and communicate impacts to all stakeholders.\nRevisit the charter—if the change alters core objectives, a charter revision may be required.\nDisciplined change management transforms scope creep from a threat into a structured opportunity for improvement.\n\n\n4. The Role of the Project Manager\nThe project manager acts as both translator and guardian—translating customer needs into actionable engineering tasks and guarding the boundaries of project scope. In medical device development, where product changes have regulatory consequences, this role carries both operational and ethical weight.\nA project that begins with a clear, VoC-based charter and disciplined scope control will not only deliver on time and within budget—it will deliver meaningfully, creating products that meet real human needs with precision and care."

The same is true for project management maturity. The highest-performing project managers are not those who control most tightly, but those who inspire others to own the mission, contribute their best, and find meaning in shared achievement.\n\nIn my career, I’ve witnessed this transformation repeatedly: engineers becoming managers, managers becoming mentors, and teams becoming movements.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Every successful project follows a rhythm—a progression from idea to outcome that, when well-managed, feels almost organic. Yet behind that rhythm lies a disciplined structure: the project lifecycle. At Moxtek, where optical and x-ray technologies demanded both innovation and precision, I came to appreciate how critical this structure is—not as bureaucracy, but as the framework that allows creativity to flourish within constraint.\nhttps://www.fda.gov/media/116573/download\nOur teams there were often balancing competing priorities: R&D pushing for faster iterations, manufacturing insisting on process control, and customers expecting reliability down to the micron. Navigating those tensions required more than technical knowledge; it demanded a lifecycle approach that aligned discovery with delivery. From initial feasibility studies and prototype builds to validation and production transfer, each phase required a deliberate handoff—ensuring that design intent became manufacturable reality without losing sight of compliance or performance.\nI recall one project in particular, developing a precision optical component for a next-generation imaging system. Early enthusiasm had led to rapid prototyping, but without a structured lifecycle, the design drifted. Reintroducing formal stage gates—requirements definition, design review, verification, and process qualification—not only brought the project back on track but also revealed hidden dependencies that ultimately improved yield and reliability.\nThat experience reinforced a simple truth: the lifecycle is not a constraint—it’s the connective tissue of project success. Whether building optical assemblies, transferring catheter lines, or implementing software systems, the principles remain the same. Each phase builds accountability, visibility, and confidence—not only in the final product but in the team delivering it.\nIn this chapter, we’ll explore the project lifecycle as both method and mindset: how clear stage definition, disciplined transitions, and early cross-functional engagement can turn complex undertakings into predictable, repeatable successes.\nIDEATION / FEASIBILITY ↓ Project Initiation • Define purpose, scope, stakeholders • Identify regulatory pathway & user needs • Establish Design and Development Plan\nDESIGN INPUT ↓ Planning • Translate user needs → design inputs • Develop system requirements & risk analysis • Establish verification and validation strategy\nDESIGN OUTPUT ↓ Execution / Development • Generate design outputs (drawings, BOMs, specifications) • Iterative builds and design reviews • Ensure traceability from input to output\nVERIFICATION ↓ Verification & Validation • Verify outputs meet inputs (testing, analysis, inspection) • Validate product meets user needs and intended use • Document in Design History File (DHF)\nDESIGN TRANSFER ↓ Transfer & Scale-Up • Transfer design to manufacturing environment • Qualify processes, equipment, and personnel • Establish Device Master Record (DMR)\nPRODUCTION & CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT ↓ Sustainment / Post-Market • Monitor performance and feedback • Implement CAPA and design changes as needed • Maintain compliance and continuous improvement\nPerfect — here’s a section-by-section walkthrough for Chapter 2: The Project Lifecycle — From Vision to Verification, expanding on the earlier introduction and diagram.\nEach phase includes (1) purpose, (2) key activities, and (3) an example from your Moxtek or medical device experience to ground it in reality."

    "text": "Chapter 2: The Project Lifecycle — From Vision to Verification\n\n1. Ideation & Feasibility — Finding the “Why”\nPurpose:\n\nEvery project begins with a problem to solve or an opportunity to pursue. The ideation phase defines why the project exists and what success looks like. It establishes the foundation—technically, commercially, and ethically—for all that follows.\nKey Activities:\n\n\nIdentify customer or internal needs\n\nAssess technical feasibility and market potential\n\nAlign project goals with business strategy\n\nDefine high-level risks, resources, and constraints\n\n\nExample — Moxtek Optical Module:\n\nAt Moxtek, an early feasibility effort explored replacing traditional aluminum housing with a thermally stable polymer to reduce weight in x-ray collimators. Initial tests confirmed feasibility, but revealed a risk of thermal distortion. This insight, discovered before formal project launch, saved months of rework later.\n\n\n\n2. Project Initiation — Defining Scope and Accountability\nPurpose:\n\nThe initiation phase translates concept into commitment. Here, the project manager defines scope, stakeholders, and regulatory pathways—ensuring the “what” and “how” are clear before execution begins.\nKey Activities:\n\n\nDevelop a Project Charter or Design and Development Plan\n\nIdentify internal and external stakeholders\n\nDefine high-level deliverables and success metrics\n\nSecure management approval and resources\n\n\nExample — Medical Device Cleanroom Upgrade:\n\nWhen leading a Class 10,000 cleanroom expansion for catheter assembly in Korea, project initiation included early alignment between engineering, quality, and local regulatory teams. This alignment clarified documentation and validation expectations, preventing costly retrofits later.\n\n\n\n3. Design Input — Translating Needs into Requirements\nPurpose:\n\nDesign Input is where customer expectations become measurable engineering targets. The FDA calls for clear, traceable requirements that drive design decisions and verification tests.\nKey Activities:\n\n\nCapture user and functional requirements\n\nConduct design risk analysis (FMEA)\n\nEstablish measurable design input specifications\n\nDefine verification and validation plans\n\n\nExample — Moxtek X-Ray Window Project:\n\nCustomer feedback requested a thinner polymer window for higher x-ray transmission. The design input process defined exact thickness tolerances, burst strength, and film adhesion requirements—linking each need to testable parameters and reducing ambiguity during development.\n\n\n\n4. Design Output — Turning Requirements into Reality\nPurpose:\n\nDesign Outputs are the tangible results of the design process—drawings, schematics, assembly procedures, and BOMs. The goal is to ensure that what’s built can consistently meet the defined inputs.\nKey Activities:\n\n\nGenerate final design documentation\n\nBuild prototypes and pilot units\n\nMaintain traceability between input and output\n\nReview for manufacturability and compliance\n\n\nExample — Catheter Transfer from Japan to U.S.:\n\nDuring technology transfer, design outputs included all manufacturing instructions, assembly drawings, and QC test protocols. Establishing strict traceability between the Japanese documentation set and U.S. equivalents ensured identical performance post-transfer.\n\n\n\n5. Verification — Checking the Design Against Its Requirements\nPurpose:\n\nVerification ensures the design meets its specified inputs. It asks, “Did we design the product right?”\nKey Activities:\n\n\nExecute verification test protocols\n\nAnalyze data to confirm design input compliance\n\nDocument results in verification reports\n\nAddress nonconformances through design review\n\n\nExample — Molding Process Development:\n\nFor thermoplastic micro-molding projects in Taiwan, verification included measuring part dimensions, tensile strength, and bonding integrity. Each test confirmed that the design outputs met the critical specifications established in the design inputs.\n\n\n\n6. Validation — Confirming Fitness for Intended Use\nPurpose:\n\nValidation answers a different question: “Did we design the right product?” It confirms that the final device meets user needs and performs as intended in real-world use.\nKey Activities:\n\n\nConduct clinical or simulated use testing\n\nValidate manufacturing processes (IQ, OQ, PQ)\n\nConfirm usability and safety\n\nDocument validation in the Design History File\n\n\nExample — In-Vitro Diagnostic Cartridge:\n\nValidation testing simulated clinical workflows, confirming that reagent stability and cartridge loading met operator needs. The process validation (OQ/PQ) ensured repeatability and robustness before market release.\n\n\n\n7. Design Transfer — Bridging Development and Manufacturing\nPurpose:\n\nDesign Transfer ensures that the design is correctly translated into production. Misalignment here leads to yield loss, delays, and compliance risks.\nKey Activities:\n\n\nPrepare Device Master Record (DMR)\n\nTrain manufacturing and QA staff\n\nQualify processes and equipment\n\nEstablish production and inspection plans\n\n\nExample — Optical Assembly Transfer:\n\nAt Moxtek, transferring assembly of an optical polarizer module to a contract manufacturer required detailed work instructions, tooling calibration, and visual standards. The result: a seamless start-up with &lt;1% first-pass defect rate.\n\n\n\n8. Production & Continuous Improvement — Sustaining Success\nPurpose:\n\nOnce in production, the focus shifts to monitoring performance, managing feedback, and driving improvement. FDA design controls require ongoing vigilance—products evolve, regulations change, and so must processes.\nKey Activities:\n\n\nMonitor field performance and customer feedback\n\nExecute CAPA and change control processes\n\nConduct internal audits and management reviews\n\nFoster continuous improvement and innovation\n\n\nExample — Continuous Improvement in Inspection Systems:\n\nA periodic review of in-line x-ray inspection metrics revealed opportunities to reduce false rejects. Updating the image analysis algorithm cut false alarms by 40%, improving throughput and reducing operator fatigue—an example of ongoing lifecycle management.\n\n\n\nClosing Thought\nProjects, like products, have lifecycles—and meaning. The discipline of managing those cycles transforms chaos into clarity and effort into impact. Whether in an optical lab or a medical device plant, the same truth applies: a well-structured lifecycle doesn’t just produce deliverables; it cultivates purpose, precision, and progress."

    "text": "In regulated industries, every design decision, document, and test result carries weight. The Design History File (DHF) and Device Master Record (DMR) form the backbone of this accountability, serving not only as compliance artifacts but as the living memory of the project itself.\nThe DHF captures the evolution of a medical device—from concept to commercialization—demonstrating that the design process followed the approved plan and met design control requirements under 21 CFR 820.30 and ISO 13485. It tells the story of how the product was designed, what choices were made, and how those choices were verified and validated.\nDuring my time managing projects that transferred catheter manufacturing lines and cleanroom upgrades across Asia and North America, maintaining the DHF wasn’t just a regulatory requirement—it was a leadership tool. When questions arose about why a material or process had been selected, or why a test method had been retired, the DHF provided both the evidence and the rationale. It anchored decision-making to documented facts, protecting both the team and the company.\nThe DMR, by contrast, defines what is needed to make the device. It is the operational blueprint—a collection of specifications, drawings, formulations, assembly procedures, and inspection criteria that ensure every product built meets its intended design. In essence, the DMR turns design intent into reproducible manufacturing reality.\nTogether, the DHF and DMR represent the full lifecycle of accountability:\nThe DHF shows how we got there. The DMR ensures we can get there again, exactly the same way.\nFor project managers, maintaining these documents isn’t administrative overhead—it’s core to delivering safe, effective products that withstand both regulatory scrutiny and the test of time. Each update, each review, each signature is part of a traceable lineage that proves the project team honored its purpose, process, and product integrity."

    "text": "Even in the darkest circumstances, life holds meaning. Often, it calls on us to fulfill a task, achieve something significant, or support someone in need—and it is this sense of purpose that sustains us through challenges. Viktor Frankl shared this insight with his fellow prisoners after a day-long fast, protecting those who had risked punishment to steal a few potatoes.\nIn my years leading projects across continents and industries, I have seen that effective project management is more than schedules, budgets, and milestones—it is about purpose, responsibility, and the meaning we bring to our work. Every project, team, and challenge carries an expectation: to create value, support others, and leave a lasting impact.\nProject management in regulated industries is both an art and a science—requiring technical expertise, disciplined process management, and the ability to lead diverse teams across functions and geographies. Throughout my career, I have managed complex programs in medical device and high-tech sectors across North America, Asia, and Europe. From multi-million-dollar technology transfers and new product development to mentoring global, cross-functional teams, I have seen how effective leadership transforms ideas into life-improving products.\nRather than condensing my career into bullet points, this booklet expands on the lessons I’ve learned—what worked, what mattered, and what it taught me about leadership, resilience, and purpose. Examples include transferring catheter and micro-catheter production lines from Japan to the U.S., leading cleanroom and facility upgrades in Korea, and developing thermoplastic and liquid silicone molding processes across Asia-Pacific. These experiences illustrate both challenges and best practices for project managers in regulated industries.\nIt is my hope that this booklet serves as both a reference and inspiration—equipping project leaders to navigate complexity, manage risk, and lead teams successfully while making a meaningful impact in their organizations.\nOur work and accomplishments often define our lives, but discovering life’s meaning through our work is far more fulfilling.\n\nDK, Wasatch Front, Fall 2025"

    "text": "Every successful project follows a rhythm—a progression from idea to outcome that, when well-managed, feels almost organic. Yet behind that rhythm lies a disciplined structure: the project lifecycle. At Moxtek, where optical and x-ray technologies demanded both innovation and precision, I came to appreciate how critical this structure is—not as bureaucracy, but as the framework that allows creativity to flourish within constraint.\nOur teams there were often balancing competing priorities: R&D pushing for faster iterations, manufacturing insisting on process control, and customers expecting reliability down to the micron. Navigating those tensions required more than technical knowledge; it demanded a lifecycle approach that aligned discovery with delivery. From initial feasibility studies and prototype builds to validation and production transfer, each phase required a deliberate handoff—ensuring that design intent became manufacturable reality without losing sight of compliance or performance.\nI recall one project in particular, developing a precision optical component for a next-generation imaging system. Early enthusiasm had led to rapid prototyping, but without a structured lifecycle, the design drifted. Reintroducing formal stage gates—requirements definition, design review, verification, and process qualification—not only brought the project back on track but also revealed hidden dependencies that ultimately improved yield and reliability.\nThat experience reinforced a simple truth: the lifecycle is not a constraint—it’s the connective tissue of project success. Whether building optical assemblies, transferring catheter lines, or implementing software systems, the principles remain the same. Each phase builds accountability, visibility, and confidence—not only in the final product but in the team delivering it.\nIn this chapter, we’ll explore the project lifecycle as both method and mindset: how clear stage definition, disciplined transitions, and early cross-functional engagement can turn complex undertakings into predictable, repeatable successes.\nIDEATION / FEASIBILITY ↓ Project Initiation • Define purpose, scope, stakeholders • Identify regulatory pathway & user needs • Establish Design and Development Plan\nDESIGN INPUT ↓ Planning • Translate user needs → design inputs • Develop system requirements & risk analysis • Establish verification and validation strategy\nDESIGN OUTPUT ↓ Execution / Development • Generate design outputs (drawings, BOMs, specifications) • Iterative builds and design reviews • Ensure traceability from input to output\nVERIFICATION ↓ Verification & Validation • Verify outputs meet inputs (testing, analysis, inspection) • Validate product meets user needs and intended use • Document in Design History File (DHF)\nDESIGN TRANSFER ↓ Transfer & Scale-Up • Transfer design to manufacturing environment • Qualify processes, equipment, and personnel • Establish Device Master Record (DMR)\nPRODUCTION & CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT ↓ Sustainment / Post-Market • Monitor performance and feedback • Implement CAPA and design changes as needed • Maintain compliance and continuous improvement"
